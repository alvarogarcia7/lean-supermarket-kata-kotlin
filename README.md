# Lean supermarket kata

I've practiced this kata, based on these [slides](https://slideshare.net/chrismdp/lean-code). 

There was another solution to this kata [here](https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/kata-lean-supermarket-java).

## Goals

To practice lean programming, but not necessarily constrained by time. I was more interested in seeing how much time it takes for features to appear, being conscious (but not constrained) about time.

I've dedicated as much time as needed to develop each feature, trying to postpone the big changes as much as possible, trying to practice ingenuity (naïveté) and 'the simplest thing that can work' (from XP).
